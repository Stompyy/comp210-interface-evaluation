                        <h2>Test Subjects in Situ</h2>
                        <h1>Who?</h1>
                        <p>As the aim of this report is to evaluate the ease in which anyone, not just an experienced game player, would find using the new control scheme; a wider sample group than my immediate peers was needed.  Twenty-two subjects were chosen from the staff and customers of a local restaurant, representing an age range of 18 - 50, from part time bar staff, to office staff and management.  A good representation of different game playing experience was found, from zero, to console, pc, and mobile, with which I hope to draw some meaningful conclusions about the validity of the new control system, in effectiveness, and ease of use.</p>
                        <p>Given the two-player nature of the game, subjects were paired off, observed playing, and interviewed afterwards about their previous game playing experience, opinions of the controls, and preference of crosshair or the new Touch's Actual Position (T.A.P.) firing method.  In addition, given the easily distracting 'after work' testing environment, the perceived interest in the test was recorded as well.</p>
                        <h1>Where?</h1>
                        <p>Whilst mirroring the target playing scenario and players, alcohol and tiredness after potentially a long shift in a busy restaurant introduces an element of unpredictability and distraction. Attempting to force a player to engage whilst their concentration is on a different conversation topic, or an unfinished game of pool nearby, could potentially result in inaccurate data. To account for this, I have attempted to quantitatively judge each subject's engagement with the play test. If needed, this can then be factored into indeterminate results to perhaps provide some clarity. This is especially important in a mobile game where attention to the screen is paramount, and as with any game, players will only engage if they are in the mood to play.</p>
                        <p>This social situ is also highly prone to positivity. Interviewing any colleague or friend as opposed to a blinded trial may introduce a politeness bias. With the two-player aspect often acting as a joint interview, the subjects may also be prone to agree with each other skewing their own results. By triangulating the results from my expert assessment (as the developer) of their ease of use of the controls, to their own assessment or preferences, then the correct conclusion should be supported.</p>
                        <p>Alcohol, even in a minute amount, will potentially tar any results gained as inaccurate, so I have chosen to limit my testing to subjects who have consumed less than three units. If a subject can be legally trusted to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/drink-drive-limit">operate a motor vehicle</a>, then I will choose to trust their ability to play this game. </p>

                        <h2>Testing Process</h2>
                        <p>The tests began by introducing them to the control instructions screen within the options menu, and talking them through it to ensure that they understood. After all, this is not an assessment of the quality of the instructions screen. They were then quizzed on their approval of the concept. This surprisingly returned unanimous positivity. I pessamistically interprete this as confirmation of a politeness bias. Afterwards they were free to navigate through the game options and play as they wished. Whether at this point they chose to compare different gun stats or maps, was a very good indication of their engagement with the test. More uninterested participants tended to rush through this, with a focus I assume to consume more than three units and return to their unfinished pool game. Whilst playing, I assessed from an expert's perspective both subject's grasp of the controls and ease of use. After playing, they were requested to play again with the alternative centre crosshair firing only, subsequently revealing their preference, and most importantly, the details of their experience of playing video games. Dissecting into console or P.C. (to determine twin stick joystick movement experience), first person shooter (FPS) or not, and lastly whether they play games on a touch screen mobile device, and if so, which?</p>

                        <h1>Previous experience playing video games aids the ease in which the controls are used.</h1>
                        <p>As predicted, the more a subject had experience playing video games, strongly positively correlated with the ease with which they could apparently control their character in the game with a correlation coefficient of 0.722.  A larger variance towards the lower end of experience could be due to a naïve willingness to accept the first FPS controls that they have ever seen, perhaps a keenness to impress, I would predict most likely a pre existing comfort with touch screen device navigation from their own phones or tablets, or possibly under estimating their previous experience - perhaps they simply haven't played recently, thereby discounting some level of skill.</p>

                        <h2>Further Observations</h2>
                        <p>All players were observed to struggle with the control's sensitivity. The option to set it per player is within the main menu options, and given the observed and qualitatively described problems; over sensitive on a phone, and under sensitive on a tablet, as the development team we must prioritise creating an in-game way to adjust this. Most likely through a mid-game pause screen. Perhaps, this indicates a larger problem with the turning and moving mechanics? A redesign of the algorithms may be necessary, or less efficiently, a platform specific profile per machine. Movement speeds are an extremely personal detail per player, with console players investing in expensive modified controllers, often costing more than the game itself, and modern PC gamers measuring their turning circle to specific dots per inch. When the second player in Battle Screens is often challenged on a whim, using the first player's device to play upon, the settings to alter the controls must be easily and quickly accessible.</p>

                    <p>After working together as a student team for a group project at <a href="https://www.falmouth.ac.uk/">Falmouth University</a> we continued to develop together as a summer project.  The limitations of mobile platforms, and the unique control options have always fascinated us, and we believe the final project to be a great representation of what is now possible using Unreal engine for mobile devices.</p>
